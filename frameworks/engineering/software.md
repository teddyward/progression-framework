### About this page
This engineering progression framework is a tool to help engineers and managers:
- talk about what we're* looking for from engineers in a consistent way
- make development and career plans
- set a fair level of compensation.

The framework is a compass, not a GPS.

It's meant to be a helpful thought exercise. It's not meant to be a rating system for humans.

### How does it work?
The framework covers all the things we're looking for from engineers at Kevala. These things are very roughly divided into four categories, across two axes. These aren't weighted equally; code mastery, for example, should probably be the primary focus of SWEIs. But they are all part of your job requirements.
- Craft - The quality of your technical contributions in our codebase
  - Code Mastery
  - Software Design and Architectural Design
  - Approach to bugs and issues
- Coordination - The alignment of your contributions to our mission
  - Decarbonization
  - Growing the team
  - Tracking work
- Impact - How your work makes life better for our users
  - Relationship to our users
  - Product ownership
  - Scaling the platform
- Influence - How your work makes life better for your coworkers
  - Processes
  - Culture
  - Relationships
  - Feedback

Every individual will have strengths and weaknesses on these axes. Your manager will work with you to make sure You are happily engaged and utilized. It should be clear, however, where your areas of growth are. If it isn't, ask in your next 1:1 :)

### What are the levels?

Integers translate directly to titles:

- 1 - SWEI
- 2 - SWEII
- 3 - Senior Software Engineer
- 4 - Staff Software Engineer
- 5 - Principal Software Engineer

These bands are quite wide. It is not reasonable to expect to rocket up them in 18 months. There is, however, ample opportunity within a band to grow your craft, coordination, impact, and influence.

### Give us your feedback!
This is a rough draft. Let us know if it should have more depth, examples, or if you disagree with what we value.

* "we" currently refers to "Teddy Ward" in this document, since the draft is _so_ rough, that I'm the only one who has seen it :p
