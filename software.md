### About this page
This engineering progression framework is a tool to help engineers and managers:
- talk about what we're* looking for from engineers in a consistent way
- make development and career plans
- set a fair level of compensation.

The framework is a compass, not a GPS.

It's meant to be a helpful thought exercise. It's not meant to be a rating system for humans.

### How does it work?
The framework covers all the things we're looking for from engineers at Kevala. These things are very roughly divided into four categories, across two axes.
- Craft - The quality of your technical contributions in our codebase
- Coordination - The alignment of your contributions to our mission
- Impact - How your work makes life better for our users
- Influence - How your work makes life better for your coworkers

Every individual will have strengths and weaknesses on these axes. Your manager will work with you to make sure You are happily engaged and utilized. It should be clear, however, where your areas of growth are. If it isn't, ask in your next 1:1 :)

### What are the levels?

Integer levels translate directly to titles:

- 1 - SWEI
- 2 - SWEII
- 3 - Senior Software Engineer
- 4 - Staff Software Engineer
- 5 - Principal Software Engineer

These bands are quite wide. It is not reasonable to expect to rocket up them in 18 months. There is, however, ample opportunity within a band to grow your craft, coordination, impact, and influence.

### Give us your feedback!
This is a rough draft. Let us know if it should have more depth, examples, or if you disagree with what we value.

* "we" currently refers to "Teddy Ward" in this document, since the draft is _so_ rough, that I'm the only one who has seen it :p
